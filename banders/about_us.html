            <h2>The first Local of banders</h2>
            <p>In May of 2023 Banders Begins in Cuernavaca Morelos Mexico, in a tiny space 
                in the street calzada de los reyes, with no more than a frier and the ingredients 
                to make each corn dog special, for the customers. With time and patience, the name 
                of banders began to spread in the whole town, lately unfortunately they needed to 
                close in this place, but Luis Jose and Kim didn’t give up, and they started to 
                make plans to open in another place and continue with banders.</p>
